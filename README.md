**Abstract.** Fake News Detection has been a challenging problem in the field of Machine Learning. Researchers have approached it via several techniques using old Statistical Classification models and modern Deep Learning. Today, with the growing amount of data, developments in the field of NLP and ML, and an increase in the computation power at disposal, there are infinite permutations and combinations to approach this problem from a different perspective. In this paper, we try different methods to tackle Fake News, and try to build, and propose the possibilities of a Hybrid Ensemble combining the classical Machine Learning techniques with the modern Deep Learning Approaches.
